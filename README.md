## General Information

This is a a multi-stage personal project to build a platform to track the care and environments of my plants.

This is the frontend for the application which will be built after the backend API is functioning.

The first stage is to build out basic [CRUD](https://github.com/mdiedricks/botanictracker-api) functionality for tracking plant-care manually, with later stages involving embedded devices to track certain data automatically.

## Technology Used

- [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/)

## Project Status

This project is in it's early stages as I build out the day-to-day functionality in the [backend api](https://github.com/mdiedricks/botanictracker-api).

#### Work to follow

- [x] Flesh-out a mobile friendly frontend - the webapp will need to be used on mobile
- [ ] Develop embedded device for manually reading soil moisture and sending it to the DB for a specific plant
- [ ] Develop embedded devices to collect daily environmental data, and periodically send it to DB
